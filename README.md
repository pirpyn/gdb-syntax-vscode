VSCode grammar extension to color higlight scripts for GDB

## Changelog
## [0.5.2] 2023-06-20
### Added
 * finish
### Modified
 * on/off/auto and other constant keyword

## Features

This extension provides a grammar file to parse and color GDB command files.

![Color highlight](images/basic.png)

Unlike other languague, GDB will accept incomplete word when there's no ambiguity, 
so `set loggging overwrite off` is as valid as `set lo ov of`.

That means that you just can't put every keyword in one regexp to render each keyword.
To have a consistant color hilight each command has it's own regexp.

Disclaimer: for the moment, all the commands that I use are rendered.
Commits will slow down. May not update at all.

### Rules
* All scopes must finish by `.gdb`.
* The scope goes from general to specific.
* For GDB commands, first scope is  `meta`. Then it depends on the GDB logic: is it a `command`, a `block`, a `variable` ? Examples:
    * `meta.block.conditional.gdb` means its a GDB block of text in a conditional statement.
    * `meta.command.delete.gdb` means its gdb's delerte command.
* One command per PR. The PR must have the .gdb to test it. Ideally, an image should be copied in the PR to show the output.

### Testing
Use the VSCode command `editor.action.inspectTMScopes` ( `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` in command palette ) to check the syntax highlighting.

Here, the comment was rendered as a `comment.line.number-sign.gdb`.
